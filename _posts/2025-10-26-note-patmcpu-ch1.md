# 1 Introduction
The trajectory of central processing unit (CPU) development is undergoing profound change. Single-core performance improvements have clearly reached a bottleneck, marking a new stage in the evolution of computing architecture.

- **2000–2010: The golden age of single-core performance**

  Performance gains mainly relied on optimizations within single-core architectures.

  **Key technical paths:** continuous clock frequency increases and fine-grained microarchitecture improvements.

  **Specific optimization directions:** improving branch prediction accuracy, deepening instruction pipelines, increasing cache capacity, and enhancing execution unit efficiency.

- **2010–2020: Multicore architectures become mainstream**

  Single-core performance growth slowed, and the era of multicore parallel computing fully began. Code optimization strategies had to be deeply customized for specific hardware architectures.

## 1.1 Why Do We Still Need Performance Tuning?
Modern software commonly suffers from severe inefficiency. For example, for 4096×4096 matrix multiplication, unoptimized code can run up to 60,000 times slower than a highly optimized version — a staggering figure. The current technological ecosystem faces three intertwined problems:

- CPU hardware will not automatically choose the optimal algorithm for your software.
- Compiler optimizations have inherent limits.
- Algorithm engineers often over-rely on theoretical time complexity and ignore real hardware characteristics.

## 1.2 Who Needs Performance Tuning?
Performance tuning is critical in the following scenarios:

- Applications with stringent real-time computing requirements.
- Large-scale distributed training jobs for artificial intelligence.
- High-performance computing environments such as cloud infrastructure.

Especially under the current exponential growth in AI compute demand, even a 1% performance improvement can yield significant large-scale benefits.

## 1.3 What Is Performance Analysis?
The core methodology of performance analysis: locate system bottlenecks based on empirical data. Optimization should be guided by precise measurement, not by subjective guesswork.

## 1.6 Chapter Summary [1]
- The growth rate of single-core CPU performance has significantly slowed; developers need to shift from relying solely on hardware to proactively optimizing software.
- Modern software faces widespread efficiency problems; unoptimized code leads to higher energy use and increased environmental pressure.
- Releasing performance potential is constrained by multiple factors: physical hardware limits, compiler optimization boundaries, and a disconnect between algorithmic models and real hardware characteristics.
- Performance engineering is moving from a niche skill to a core discipline; software vendors increasingly recognize the direct impact of efficiency on business outcomes.
- User experience is tightly coupled with performance; responsiveness has become a must-have trait for leading software.
- The importance of software tuning has reached a historic high; small optimizations can have decisive effects through scale.
- Extracting extreme performance requires building a complete mental model of CPU microarchitecture.
- The factors that affect modern platform performance are highly complex — systematic performance analysis tools must replace intuition-based judgments.
